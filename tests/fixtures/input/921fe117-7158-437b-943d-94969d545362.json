Because the main ACLED dataset is disaggregated, ACLED data can be aggregated both spatially (e.g. to the national level) and temporally (e.g. to the month or year level), among other options. When a user downloads ACLED\u2019s disaggregated event-based data, each row in the file represents a single event occurring between designated actors in a specific named location on a specific day. In the spatially and temporarily aggregated files available on HDX, each row in the data represents a country-year (e.g. Iraq-2017) or a country-month-year (e.g. Somalia-January 2010), depending on the file.
